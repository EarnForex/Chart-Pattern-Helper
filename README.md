# Chart Pattern Helper

**Warning! This expert advisor doesn't trade in a fully automatic mode! It only trades based on the chart patterns you draw on the chart.**

Chart Pattern Helper is a custom MT4/MT5 expert advisor coded by EarnForex.com. Its main purpose is to create and manage trading orders based on chart patterns (mainly channels) drawn by a trader. It is only capable of trading breakout setups, not pullbacks.

Chart objects have to be properly named for the Chart Pattern Helper EA to work. Please read the EA's and its input parameters' descriptions carefully before employing it on a live account.
